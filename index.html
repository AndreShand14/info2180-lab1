        <p>Hello my name is Andre Shand, 24 years old persusing a batchelors in Computer Science with a minor in Economics.
            From a young age gaming was my main passion, however as of late am not getting that high off playing games anymore.
            Therefore I have made the choice to focus most of this gaming energy into something that might can be of use to me 
            in the future , which is coding. After I obtain this batchelors I will take my first steps in the cybersecurity arena.
        </p>>
